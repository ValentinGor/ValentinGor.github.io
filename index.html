                                        Full-cycle website development: I was responsible for taking websites from
                                        design to live deployment, which helped me master the entire development
                                        process, from front-end development to integration with back-end systems.

                                        Collaboration with designers: I implemented Figma layouts into code, working
                                        closely with design teams to bring their concepts to life with high accuracy.

                                        SEO and cross-browser compatibility: I optimized websites for better search
                                        engine rankings and ensured they worked smoothly across different browsers,
                                        contributing to better user experiences and site visibility.

                                    This experience helped me grow into a more seasoned Frontend Developer, able to
                                    handle more complex projects and work effectively within teams. It also solidified
                                    my ability to take full ownership of projects, from conception to completion, with a
                                    focus on performance and user experience.
